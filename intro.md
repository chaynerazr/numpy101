# Welcome to Numpy101

(introduction-h2)=
## Introduction

This book is inspired by [Python101](https://python101.ml/intro.html) to explain how numpy doing. Many content here is just from default content when you run the following commands. 

```shell
jupyter-book create my-book/
```

This required you to have install python package from [Jupuyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)

The book is the final assignment from the course [The Data Science Toolbook](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/courses/data-science-toolbox/fs041) which only intentionally teach how to use tool related to data scientist.

I also want to apologise for spelling & english gramartically mistake on this book. This include using informal language and being very non-academic. And from time to time you might get shown the unrelated picture of Jupiter like this:
